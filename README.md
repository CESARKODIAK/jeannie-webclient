# Limitations

 * Only Chrome supports speech recognition via Google, but other Browser will work too via keyboard.
 * Text to speech only works on our domain. You can create your own avatar on [sitepal](http://sitepal.com/).
 * The Google login is currently [not working](https://github.com/pannous/jeannie-webclient/issues/1) for Safari - we'd like your pull request!
 * To make calls skype is necessary (your browser has to support [skype URLs](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12243/how-do-i-enable-skype-click-to-call-in-chrome)) and your contact needs to have a telephon number associated (in google contacts).
